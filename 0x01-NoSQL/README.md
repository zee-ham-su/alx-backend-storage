This directory contains the code and resources related to the NoSQL topic.

## Description

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a type of database management system that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema and can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
